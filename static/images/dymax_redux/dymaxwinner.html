The Buckminster Fuller Institute is happy to announce the winner of <a href="http://bfi.org/mapcontest">DYMAX REDUX</a>, an open call to create a new and inspiring interpretation of Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map. <a href="http://bfi-internal.org/2013_Map_Contest/final_lrg/271x.jpg">Dymaxion Wood Ocean World</a> by Nicole Santucci of Woodcut Maps (San Francisco, CA) has been selected as the winner out of a pool of over 300 entrants from 42 countries. <a href="http://bfi-internal.org/2013_Map_Contest/final_lrg/272.jpg">Clouds Dymaxion Map</a> by Anne-Gaelle Amiot of France was selected as the runner up. 
<br><br>"This was the first contest of its kind organized by BFI, and the response and interest has been amazing. We are thrilled to have such a high level of submissions and look forward to doing more similar initiatives in the future" says BFI Executive Director Elizabeth Thompson, noting the <a href="http://bfi.org/mapcontest#press">great press coverage to-date</a>.


<br><br>The Buckminster Fuller Institute will produce the winning entry as a poster and include it in with the <a href="http://bfi.goodsie.com/">BFI online educational resource store</a>. In addition, we have highlighted three entries that were chosen by our guest critics - Nicholas Felton, Mary Mattingly and Shoji Sadao - as their favorite individual picks. The winner and runner-up along with the other nine finalists will be featured at an in-person exhibition at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, scheduled for later this fall.

<strong>The Winner:</strong><font size="2"> &nbsp; <i>Dymaxion Woodocean World</i> &nbsp; <a href="http://woodcutmaps.com/">Nicole Santucci + Woodcut Maps</a> &nbsp; United States
<br>Nicole Santucci and team created a wonderful display of global forest densities, an ever-increasing important issue with the continued abuses of deforestation. What's more an actual woodcut version of the map was made in the process, allowing the 2-D version to transform into an icosahedral globe. As BFI Store Coordinator Will Elkins put it "They went above and beyond our call by creating a powerful display of relevant information using the subject matter itself as a medium. The idea, craftsmanship and end result are stunning."

<font size="3"><strong>The Runner-Up:</strong><font size="2"> &nbsp; <i>Clouds Dymaxion Map</i> &nbsp; <a href="http://cargocollective.com/ag-amiot">Anne-Gaelle Amiot</a> &nbsp; France
<br>Anne-Gaelle Amiot used NASA satelitte imagery to create this absolutely beautiful hand-drawn depiction of a reality that is almost always edited from our maps: cloud patterns circling above Earth. Anne-Gaelle describes the idea and process "One of the particularism of Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion projection is to give the vision of an unified world. From the space, the Earth appears to us coverd, englobed by the cloud masses which circulate around it. By drawing a static image, capture of clouds position in one particular moment, the sensation of a whole is created. The result have the aspect of an abstract pattern, a huge melt where it is impossible to dissociate lands, seas, oceans."

<font size="3"><strong>Nicholas Felton Pick:</strong><font size="2"> &nbsp; <i>Map of My Family</i> &nbsp; <a href="http://www.geoffchristou.com/">Geoff Christou</a> &nbsp; Canada<br>
"This map makes the best use of the Dymaxion projection, by hilighting information that is primarily land-based and allowing for the paths to extend in an unbroken fashion throughout the world." - Nicholas Felton

<font size="3"><strong>Mary Mattingly Pick:</strong><font size="2"> &nbsp; <i>Spaceship Earth: Climatic Regions</i> &nbsp; Ray Simpson &nbsp; United States
<br>"Eliminates human-made borders and focuses on mapping the shifting yet distinct climactic planes. This utopian projection relies only on geographic and geologic borders, truly a project Buckminster Fuller would appreciate." - Mary Mattingly
